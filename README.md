# About Me

🎓 Graduated with a degree in Theoretical Physics in 2016.

💻 Transitioned into frontend development in 2016.

📺 Since 2017, I've been primarily working in the live business as a backend developer using Java.
My experience includes developing IM systems and features for live streaming monetization such as virtual gifting, red packets, lucky draws, and prize wheels. 
Our company's app boasts a monthly active user base of approximately 300 million, with around 10 million monthly active users specifically engaging with the live streaming functionalities.

🌐 I am now actively learning about Web3 technologies, including Solidity, Uniswap V3, and wallet development,
with the goal of transitioning into a backend development role within the Web3 space.
